# WebAudio API Keyword spotting

This is a wrapper around [pocketsphinx.js](https://github.com/syl22-00/pocketsphinx.js)
designed for use in the browser in conjunction with the WebAudio API and any
input the WebAudio API accepts.

## Usage (Keyword Spotting)

First set up an audio source for the Web Audio API:

```JS
import { PocketSphinx, Audio as PsAudio } from 'psjs';

// Create a Web Audio Context
const audioContext = new AudioContext();

// Set up a source from the user's media input
// See:
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext/createMediaStreamSource
// for an example of how to accomplish this.
const source = ...;

```

Next, you need to set up Speech recognition and attach the node to the audio
API graph.

Because we load what is essentially a binary containing the pocketsphinx code,
you need to specify its location, along with the worker code (distributed as
part of this library).

We then initialize with a dictionary, that outlines words and their possible
pronunciations (see the [CMU dictionary format](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict)).
And set up a keyword using words found in the dictionary.

```JS
const speechRecognition = new PocketSphinx(audioContext, {
  pocketSphinxUrl: 'dist/pocketsphinx.js', // Path to the emscripten bundle
  workerUrl: 'dist/ps-worker.js', // Path to the pocketsphinx worker URL
});

const dictionary = {
  'MOZILLA': ['M AA Z IH L AH', 'M AA Z IH L ER'],
  'HELLO': ['HH AH L OW'],
};

speechRecognition.addDictionary(dictionary))
  .then(() => speechRecognition.addKeyword('HELLO MOZILLA'))
  .then(() => {
    // Connect your source to the speech recognition
    source.connect(speechRecognition);
  })
  .catch(console.error);

speechRecognition.on('keywordspotted', (event) => {
  console.log(`Spotted keyword ${event.keyword}`);
});
```

## TODO

- Full pocketsphinx capabilities (grammars etc)
- Remove polyfill for composite nodes when supported by Web Audio API
- Use AudioWorker once supported.
